// Main program file

// The functions in this program were written by Will Moyle as part of his MSc
// Degree in Computing Science from Imperial College, London

// The code in this main file was written by the academic staff at the university
// and is designed to test the functions written by Will Moyle that can be found
// in other files

// The program simulates a game of chess in which each user inputs their moves
// as coordinates. The resulting board is then printed to the console.
